### What Software Engineering means to me.

To me Software Engineering is the creation of code to efficiently acheive certain goals set at the begining of a project.  This does not mean however that changes cannot be made to the plan that is initialy created, sometimes a project evolves outside of the original parameters that were set, new features to be added and such.

It is also worth mentioning that to me the most important part of software engineering is efficiency, sure it is great if there is an easy to navigate UI or features upon features, however if the intial goals of the project are impaired by feature creep or other issues then it becomes a problem.
