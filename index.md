Here is a collection of works from CSCI 260!

### Why I am Taking software engineering.

I am taking software engineering for a few reasons.  Probably the most aparent and insignificant reason for me taking the class is that it is part of the requirements for my major, however I am guessing this is the case for all of the other studentds in the class.  Far more important to me is that I learn how to better myself as a developer, whether this is in my style, tools I have at my disposal, or any other potential outlets that will come up over the course of the class.

The main take aways that I hope to gain from the course are for one a much better understanding of git and using the console to manipulate hardware and repository systems. I have actualy really enjoyed all of the experience I have had with git so far due to the fact that it does not feel like an impossible task compare to some of the projects I have worked on in the past, every issue I have run into I have managed to rectify the issues after a few minutes of carefull analysis and the occasional Google search, even if I have had to walk away for a minute due to frustraition.  The other main take away that I would like to get from the course is a better understanding of java and C++, my experiences in the past have not always been the most enjoyable and I feel like that has hampered some of my learning ability with them.

### What Software Engineering means to me.

To me Software Engineering is the creation of code to efficiently acheive certain goals set at the begining of a project.  This does not mean however that changes cannot be made to the plan that is initialy created, sometimes a project evolves outside of the original parameters that were set, new features to be added and such.

It is also worth mentioning that to me the most important part of software engineering is efficiency, sure it is great if there is an easy to navigate UI or features upon features, however if the intial goals of the project are impaired by feature creep or other issues then it becomes a problem.
